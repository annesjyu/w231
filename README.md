# Cross-Border Data Flows & Privacy

Global economy depends on the transfer of data.

**Cross-border Data Transfers (CBDT)** usually means personal data collected from one location are transferred to a third country or international organization. CBDT restrictions fall into two general categories:

* *Privacy Regulations*: the process subject to compliance with set conditions, including conditions for onward transfer. Once conditions are met, transfers are allowed. It typically involves matters like, [Top 10 operational impacts of the GDPR: Part 4 - Cross-border data transfers][1]

* Data subject consent,
* Data anonymization,
* Breach notification,
* trans-border data transfers,
* Appointment data protection officers,
  * one government agency with enforcement authority
  * one third-party accountability agent

* *Data Localization*: ban on transferring data out of the country or require the organization to build or use local infrastructure and servers.

### Privacy Regulations

Regulations and policies regarding CBDT are varied depending on where the data come from and go to. The types of data also matter in this case. For example,

* The EU GDPR allows personal data transfers to a third country only if a set of conditions are fulfilled.
* The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) promotes cross-border data flows with some conditions as well.
* The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework established a principles-based model for national privacy laws that recognized the importance of 

> effective privacy protections that avoid barriers to information flows.”

Within which, each APEC member was encouraged to implement their domestic privacy laws based on the principles in this framework.

## Where CBDT Applies?

Suprised, in many situations CBDT occurs. For example,

* Coorperate emails, customer communications.
* Data analysis to optimize global logistics.
* Outsource customer support services.
* HR for global workforces.
* Global researches.
* Use Internet to query, post or update information locating overseas.

There are other situations, for example, accidental or intentional data breaches.

## Data Localization
On the other extreme side, banning data transfers, is called **Data localization** or **data residency**, which regulates means data about a nations' citizens or residents be collected, processed or stored inside the country. The requirement for localization increased after the incident by ex CIA - *Edward Snowden*, who leaked highly classified information from NSA in 2013. Also goverments in Europe and across the world are starting to realize the perils brought by data flow through technology. The emerging trend is becoming to enforce data are consumed on the spot before serve upper applications. Germany and France are the first to approve data localization laws, following by EU in 2017.

### DL Laws are Highly Regional
Each country could have its own laws for diffent types of data. For example, Australia regulates its health records, Canada restricts personal data from public service providers, and China restricts more including personal, business, and financial data. [Data localization][2]
